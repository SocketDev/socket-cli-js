[![Follow @SocketSecurity](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/SocketSecurity?style=social)](https://twitter.com/SocketSecurity)

> CLI tool for [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/)

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli
```

```bash
socket --help
socket info webtorrent@1.9.1
socket report create package.json --view
socket report view QXU8PmK7LfH608RAwfIKdbcHgwEd_ZeWJ9QEGv05FJUQ
socket wrapper --enable
```

## Commands

- `socket info <package@version>` - Look up issues for a package.

- `socket optimize` - Optimize dependencies with
  [`@socketregistry`](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-registry) overrides
  _(ðŸ‘€ [our blog post](https://socket.dev/blog/introducing-socket-optimize)!)_

  - `--pin` - Pin overrides to their latest version
  - `--prod` - Only add overrides for production dependencies

- `socket raw-npm` and `socket raw-npx` - Temporarily disable the Socket
  'safe-npm' wrapper.

- `socket report create <path(s)-to-folder-or-file>` - creates a report on
  [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/)

  Upload the specified `package.json` and lock files for JavaScript, Python, and
  Go dependency manifests. If any folder is specified, the ones found in there
  recursively are uploaded.

  Supports globbing such as `**/package.json`, `**/requirements.txt`,
  `**/pyproject.toml`, and `**/go.mod`.

  Ignores any file specified in your project's `.gitignore`, the
  `projectIgnorePaths` in your project's
  [`socket.yml`](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/socket-yml) and on top of that has
  a sensible set of
  [default ignores](https://socket.dev/npm/package/ignore-by-default)

- `socket report view <report-id>` - Look up issues and scores from a report.

- `socket wrapper --enable` and `socket wrapper --disable` - Enable and disable
  the Socket 'safe-npm' wrapper.

## Aliases

All aliases support the flags and arguments of the commands they alias.

- `socket ci` - alias for `socket report create --view --strict` which creates a
  report and quits with an exit code if the result is unhealthy. Use like eg.
  `socket ci .` for a report for the current folder

## Flags

### Command specific flags

- `--view` - when set on `socket report create` the command will immediately do
  a `socket report view` style view of the created report, waiting for the
  server to complete it

### Output flags

- `--json` - outputs result as json which you can then pipe into
  [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and other tools
- `--markdown` - outputs result as markdown which you can then copy into an
  issue, PR or even chat

## Strictness flags

- `--all` - by default only `high` and `critical` issues are included, by
  setting this flag all issues will be included
- `--strict` - when set, exits with an error code if report result is deemed
  unhealthy

### Other flags

- `--dry-run` - like all CLI tools that perform an action should have, we have a
  dry run flag. Eg. `socket report create` supports running the command without
  actually uploading anything
- `--debug` - outputs additional debug output. Great for debugging, geeks and us
  who develop. Hopefully you will never _need_ it, but it can still be fun,
  right?
- `--help` - prints the help for the current command. All CLI tools should have
  this flag
- `--version` - prints the version of the tool. All CLI tools should have this
  flag

## Configuration files

The CLI reads and uses data from a
[`socket.yml` file](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/socket-yml) in the folder you
run it in. It supports the version 2 of the `socket.yml` file format and makes
use of the `projectIgnorePaths` to excludes files when creating a report.

## Environment variables

- `SOCKET_SECURITY_API_KEY` - if set, this will be used as the API-key

## Contributing

### Environment variables for development

- `SOCKET_SECURITY_API_BASE_URL` - if set, this will be the base for all
  API-calls. Defaults to `https://api.socket.dev/v0/`
- `SOCKET_SECURITY_API_PROXY` - if set to something like
  [`http://127.0.0.1:9090`](https://docs.proxyman.io/troubleshooting/couldnt-see-any-requests-from-3rd-party-network-libraries),
  then all request will be proxied through that proxy
